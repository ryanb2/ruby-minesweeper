# Ruby Minesweeper

A ruby project I wrote for my CIT 383 Scripting I class.

The program takes in a text file formatted to simulate a minefield in a grid layout. The file gets loaded into the game to create the minefield. Then the user gets prompted to select locations on the grid to check for mines.

As of now there isn't really any GUI set up for this game, just simple command line fun.
